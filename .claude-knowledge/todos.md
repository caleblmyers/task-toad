# TaskToad — Remaining Work

76 swarm waves complete. Production deployed on Railway at `tasktoad.app`. Pipeline mechanics work; launching as closed-source SaaS.

---

## Launch Blockers

- [ ] **Landing page polish** — current version is functional but needs professional design work
- [ ] **Test signup flow on prod** — verify Resend emails arrive, full signup→verify→login works
- [x] **Resend verification email from login page** — unauthenticated `requestVerificationEmail` mutation + login page resend button *(Wave 76)*
- [x] Custom domain — `tasktoad.app` registered on Cloudflare, DNS pointed to Railway *(2026-03-30)*
- [x] SMTP setup — Resend configured for transactional email *(2026-03-30)*
- [ ] Stripe integration for billing

---

## UX

- [x] PriorityDropdown: keyboard accessibility (arrow keys, Escape to close, ARIA attributes) *(Wave 76)*
- [ ] Release notes: manual entry option
- [ ] Time entry deletion: admin-only
- [ ] Mobile: horizontal scrolling on project page
- [ ] Replace stacked modals with single-panel wizard (step 1 of N) — lower priority

---

## Pipeline

- [x] Branch cleanup on session timeout — `cancelSessionPlans()` shared helper handles timeout + budget cap *(Wave 76)*
- [x] **merge_pr executor: auto-update branch before merge** — `updatePullRequestBranch()` + auto-retry *(Wave 76)*
- [x] **merge_pr executor: detect already-merged PR** — `getPullRequestState()` check before merge *(Wave 76)*
- [x] **merge_pr executor: handle merge conflicts** — structured `errorReason` field *(Wave 76)*
- [ ] SSE cross-tab: consider adding a leader tab indicator in dev mode for debugging

---

## Code Quality & Testing

- [x] Test coverage for fix_review (approved skip, AI fixes with source, deferred tasks, duplicate detection) *(Wave 76)*
- [ ] Integration test for logout→login-as-different-user flow
- [ ] merge-worker.sh: auto-detect lockfile changes
- [ ] Test coverage for merge_pr executor (auto-update retry, state checks, conflict handling)
- [ ] Audit remaining Prisma status filters for stale values (`'pending'`/`'running'` vs `'approved'`/`'executing'`)

---

## Refactors

- [ ] **Split useProjectData** — 100+ properties → focused sub-interfaces
- [ ] **Resolver auth guards** — `requireEntity<T>()` helper, do incrementally
- [ ] **AI feature registry** — consolidate 40+ wrapper functions in aiService.ts
- [ ] **Extract insight generation to event listeners** — move from actionExecutor to async event-driven pattern

---

## Future

- [ ] Scheduled report delivery (depends on SMTP — now configured)
- [ ] License gating test coverage

---

## Manual Testing

- [ ] Verify concurrent plan execution doesn't corrupt branch state
- [ ] Verify failed plan leaves branch in recoverable state

---
