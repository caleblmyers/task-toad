# TaskToad — Remaining Work & Tracking

Production deployed at `https://tasktoad-api-production.up.railway.app`. 50 swarm waves completed. Security: 38/39 (97%). All P1 complete. 14 P2 features shipped. Zero lint warnings. 330 tests.

---

## Swarm Rules

- **Task sizing:** 30-60 min per task. Full vertical slices (schema + resolver + typeDefs + frontend).
- **Parallelism:** Check file overlap. Two sets can run in parallel if their `files` arrays don't overlap.
- **File structure:** Prisma: `prisma/schema/`, TypeDefs: `typedefs/`, Resolvers: `resolvers/` — all domain-split.

---

## Priority Order

1. Manual testing (12 test groups below) — find real bugs
2. Remaining ops (Sentry, UptimeRobot, SMTP, Railway health check)
3. Remaining security (L-5, L-12)
4. Remaining P1 features (automation, scheduled reports, SLA)
5. P2 features — only after everything above is solid

---

## Deployment & Ops

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Railway health check in service settings (auto-restart on failure)
- [ ] Custom domain (optional — Railway domain works for beta)
- [ ] Run data migration scripts in production (`migrate-encrypt-secrets.ts`, `migrate-hash-invite-tokens.ts`)

### Observability
- [ ] Verify Sentry receives errors in production
- [ ] UptimeRobot monitor: HTTP check on `/api/health` every 5 min
- [ ] Sentry integration for web frontend ErrorBoundary (currently suppresses console.error in prod)

### Email (optional for beta)
- [ ] SMTP provider configured (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `EMAIL_FROM`)
- [ ] Email verification and password reset flows tested

---

## Manual Testing Plan

Test against production: `https://tasktoad-api-production.up.railway.app`

### Test 1: Onboarding Flow
- [ ] Sign up with real email — verify error is graceful if SMTP not configured (no crash)
- [ ] Sign up, log in, create an org
- [ ] Set Anthropic API key in org settings — verify it saves, hint shows last 4 chars

### Test 2: Project Creation
- [ ] Create a project manually (name + description)
- [ ] "Generate Project Options" with AI — returns 3 options, pick one, preview task plan, commit
- [ ] Tasks appear in Backlog tab with correct statuses

### Test 3: Task Lifecycle
- [ ] Create task manually, edit title/description/priority/status
- [ ] Assign yourself, add due date, add story points
- [ ] Change status on Board tab (drag or dropdown) — verify status↔column sync
- [ ] Add comment with @mention — notification appears
- [ ] Add/remove label
- [ ] Archive task, verify hidden, toggle "show archived" to see it

### Test 4: Sprint Workflow
- [ ] Create sprint with custom columns and WIP limits
- [ ] Drag tasks from backlog into sprint
- [ ] Activate sprint — Board tab shows it
- [ ] Move tasks between columns — WIP limit warnings appear (red/amber)
- [ ] Close sprint — test "move incomplete tasks" options

### Test 5: Hierarchy
- [ ] Create initiative → epic → story → task chain
- [ ] EpicsView tree renders with expand/collapse
- [ ] Click nested task — breadcrumbs show full chain
- [ ] Progress bars aggregate correctly up hierarchy

### Test 6: Time Tracking
- [ ] Open task, log time (30 min, today)
- [ ] Log more time — total accumulates
- [ ] "Logged vs estimated" display when task has estimated hours
- [ ] Delete a time entry

### Test 7: Saved Views & Filters
- [ ] Apply filters (status + priority), save as view
- [ ] Clear filters, reload saved view — restores correctly
- [ ] Share view — appears under "Shared Views"
- [ ] Advanced filter builder — create OR group, apply, verify results

### Test 8: Permissions
- [ ] In Members tab, change role to "viewer" on a project
- [ ] Verify buttons disabled (can't create/edit tasks)
- [ ] Change role to "editor" — can create/edit again

### Test 9: Charts & Analytics
- [ ] Dashboard tab — velocity, burndown, cumulative flow charts render
- [ ] Cycle Time panel — date range presets work
- [ ] Portfolio page — rollup stat cards show aggregate data

### Test 10: Releases
- [ ] Create release (name + version)
- [ ] Add tasks to release
- [ ] Generate release notes (requires Anthropic key)
- [ ] Change release status (draft → scheduled → released)

### Test 11: Responsive & Edge Cases
- [ ] Phone-width viewport — sidebar collapses, navigation works
- [ ] Very long task title/description — layout doesn't break
- [ ] Rapid task switching — no stale data or race conditions
- [ ] Two tabs, edit same task — no data loss
- [ ] Log out → access /app — redirects to login

### Test 12: Real-Time (SSE)
- [ ] Two browser tabs on same project
- [ ] Create task in tab 1 — appears in tab 2 without refresh
- [ ] Change task status in tab 1 — tab 2 updates

## Security — Remaining (1 of 39)

- [ ] **L-12:** Test database credentials in CI/CD

Full report: `.claude-knowledge/security-audit.md`

---

## Deferred Polish

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add integration tests for `previewHierarchicalPlan` and `commitHierarchicalPlan` resolvers
- [ ] SLA: paused time handling (task reopened, weekends/business hours)

### Features
- [ ] KB entry search/filter in KnowledgeBasePanel when entry count grows large
- [ ] PlanDependencyEditor: subtask-level dependencies not supported
- [ ] ExecutionDashboard: dependency visualization between plans
- [ ] ExecutionDashboard: stat cards count from filtered list — use separate all-plans query
- [ ] Orchestrator: add metrics/observability
- [ ] Shared-types expansion — add Report type to `@tasktoad/shared-types`
- [ ] S3 multipart upload — current 10MB limit uses single PUT
- [ ] useAsyncData adoption — migrate components with inline fetch-in-useEffect

### Reliability
- [ ] monitor_ci: make polling resilient to process restarts
- [ ] cancelActionPlan: verify it interrupts actively executing actions
- [ ] Planning prompt: validate monitor_ci/fix_ci source action IDs in schema
- [ ] AI rate limiter: consider in-memory cache/sliding window for high-throughput orgs
- [ ] Anthropic SDK maxRetries=0 — consider app-level retry with capped backoff
- [ ] M-7: consider making email redaction default with admin opt-out

### Tooling
- [ ] Swarm planning: when two tasks add Prisma models, they conflict in shared import files — note dependency or have workers rebase
