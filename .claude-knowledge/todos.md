# Deferred Ideas & Future Improvements

Organized into **Task Sets** optimized for parallel swarm development. Each set is self-contained — a single worker handles it start to finish without blocking or being blocked by other workers running simultaneously.

---

## Parallel Execution Model (updated 2026-03-16)

Both `schema.prisma` and `schema.ts` have been **modularized into domain files**:
- Prisma: `apps/api/prisma/schema/` — one `.prisma` file per domain (auth, org, project, task, sprint, etc.)
- GraphQL typeDefs: `apps/api/src/graphql/typedefs/` — one `.ts` file per domain
- Resolvers: `apps/api/src/graphql/resolvers/` — already split by domain

### Swarm Assignment Rules

1. **Check file overlap.** Two sets can run in parallel if their `files` arrays don't overlap.
2. **Independent sets run freely.** Assign to any available worker in any wave.
3. **Workers work uninterrupted.** Each set is fully self-contained — no cross-set dependencies within a wave.

### Task Sizing (CRITICAL)

Each swarm task MUST represent **30-60 minutes** of focused agentic work. Never create tasks that are just config changes or single-file edits.

- **Combine into full vertical slices:** schema + resolver + typeDefs + frontend in ONE task, not separate tasks per layer.
- **Bundle config into features:** A caching config change is part of the feature it supports, not its own task.
- **Target:** Each worker should have 2-4 tasks totaling 30-60 min, not 6 tasks totaling 5 min.
- **Bad example:** "Add customField to Prisma schema" (2 min) → "Add resolver for customField" (3 min) → "Add UI for customField" (5 min)
- **Good example:** "Add custom fields on tasks — Prisma model, GraphQL types/resolver CRUD, TaskDetailPanel UI, filtering support" (45 min)

## Priority Order

1. **P1 + P2** — Production & security hardening (blocks safe deployment)
2. **A11** — Accessibility (legal/compliance risk, user experience)
3. **Q1** — Code quality & testing (enables safe refactoring)
4. **W2** — Advanced tasks & filters (feature work)
5. **I1 + D1** — Integration completeness & observability
6. **F1** — Frontend performance (only matters at scale)
7. **S1** — Styling & branding (waiting on style guide)

---

## Work Sets

### P1: Production Hardening (High Priority)
**Why:** Missing critical production infrastructure — no graceful shutdown, no error tracking, no connection pooling.
**Touches:** `apps/api/src/index.ts`, `apps/api/src/app.ts`, `apps/api/prisma/schema/`, `apps/web/src/App.tsx`

- [x] Graceful shutdown handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT) — close Prisma, SSE connections, clear intervals on redeploy (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Sentry error tracking integration — capture unhandled exceptions, GraphQL errors, and AI failures
- [ ] Prisma connection pooling — configure pool size or add PgBouncer for Railway's PostgreSQL
- [x] Environment validation improvements — warn if SMTP not configured in production, validate ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [x] Static asset caching headers — `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable` for hashed assets, `no-cache` for index.html (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [x] React Error Boundary — global error boundary at App root with fallback UI (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Wire up webhook retry processor — `startRetryProcessor()` / `stopRetryProcessor()` exported but not called from `index.ts` (needs graceful shutdown integration)
- [ ] SSE connection cleanup in graceful shutdown — `closeAllConnections` from sseManager not called in shutdown handler

### P2: Security Hardening (High Priority)
**Why:** Several medium-severity security gaps: unbounded GraphQL depth, missing CSRF, bulk mutation auth gaps, SSE token in query string.
**Touches:** `apps/api/src/graphql/schema.ts`, `apps/api/src/app.ts`, `apps/api/src/utils/sseManager.ts`, `apps/api/src/graphql/resolvers/task.ts`

- [ ] GraphQL query depth + complexity limits — configure graphql-yoga with `depthLimit` and `costLimit` plugins to prevent nested query DoS
- [ ] Rate limit SSE connections — add per-user concurrent connection limit in sseManager (max 5 per user)
- [ ] Rate limit export endpoints — stricter per-endpoint limit (5 exports per 10 min) to prevent bandwidth abuse
- [ ] Bulk mutation role checks — `bulkUpdateTasks` only checks org, not per-project membership; add project-level auth
- [ ] Move SSE token from query string to header — query params get logged in server logs, leaking tokens
- [ ] Comment mention regex hardening — add content length check or iteration cap to prevent ReDoS on large comments

### A11: Accessibility Foundation (High Priority)
**Why:** App fails WCAG 2.1 Level A on multiple criteria — keyboard nav, focus management, ARIA labels, color contrast.
**Touches:** `apps/web/src/components/` (most component files), `apps/web/src/pages/AppLayout.tsx`

- [x] Modal accessibility — shared `<Modal>` with focus trap, aria-modal, aria-labelledby, Escape-to-close, focus restore. 19 modals converted (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [x] ARIA labels on all icon-only buttons — close/clear/dismiss buttons, all 22 SVG icons have aria-hidden (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Form label associations — connect all `<label>` elements to inputs via `htmlFor`/`id` in TaskFieldsPanel, SprintCreateModal, filter inputs
- [x] Screen reader live regions — ToastContainer has aria-live="polite", error toasts use role="alert" (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [x] Skip-to-content link — sr-only visible on focus, jumps to #main-content (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Color contrast fixes — upgrade `text-slate-300/400` to `text-slate-600/700` on light backgrounds throughout. Audit all Tailwind color pairings against WCAG AA (4.5:1 ratio)
- [x] Drag-and-drop keyboard alternative — Enter/Space to enter move mode, arrow keys to move between columns, Escape to exit (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Backlog keyboard navigation — backlog sprint sections don't have keyboard move support yet (only KanbanBoard does)
- [ ] KanbanBoard move mode: Up/Down arrow keys for reordering within a column (only Left/Right cross-column moves implemented)

### Q1: Code Quality & Testing (Medium Priority)
**Why:** Zero test coverage, inconsistent error handling, duplicated modal patterns, dead code.
**Touches:** `apps/web/src/components/`, `apps/web/src/hooks/`, `apps/api/src/graphql/resolvers/`, new `__tests__/` directories

- [x] Base Modal component — shared `<Modal>` with focus trap, ARIA, Escape-to-close (completed as part of A11 Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Consistent error handling — replace silent `catch { return }` blocks with user-visible error feedback via toast. Audit: CommentSection, NotificationCenter, GlobalSearchModal, AppLayout
- [ ] Unit test foundation — set up Jest + React Testing Library, write tests for critical hooks (useTaskFiltering, useTaskCRUD) and utility functions (resolverHelpers, tokenEstimator)
- [ ] Integration test foundation — set up test database, write resolver tests for auth flows and task CRUD
- [ ] TypeScript strictness — eliminate `any` types and untyped JSON.parse calls; add Zod validation for parsed JSON from DB fields (suggestedTools, dependsOn, columns)
- [ ] Dead code cleanup — remove unused SSE event handler in AppLayout, audit for other unused exports

### W1: Full-Stack Quality Refactor (remaining)
**Touches:** `resolvers/*`, `typedefs/*`, `ProjectDetail.tsx`

- [x] Fix inconsistent mutation return types — `deleteComment` and `markAllNotificationsRead` return affected objects (Wave 8, 2026-03-16)
- [x] Add cursor-based pagination — `activities` and `reports` queries with cursor/hasMore/nextCursor (Wave 8, 2026-03-16)

### W2: Advanced Tasks & Filters
**Touches:** `prisma/schema/task.prisma`, `typedefs/task.ts`, `resolvers/task.ts`, `TaskDetailPanel.tsx`, `useProjectData.ts`, `useTaskFiltering.ts`, `FilterBar.tsx`
**Est. time:** 45-60 min

- [x] Custom fields on tasks — 4 field types with CRUD, TaskDetailPanel rendering, FilterBar integration (Wave 8, 2026-03-16)
- [x] Saved filters / views — save/load/delete filter configurations in FilterBar (Wave 8, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Multiple assignees — support multiple `assigneeId`s per task. Full slice: join table in Prisma, GraphQL type update, resolver update, assignee picker UI supporting multi-select
- [ ] Recurring tasks — auto-recreate on schedule. Full slice: Prisma fields (recurrenceRule, recurrenceParentId), cron/scheduler utility, creation logic, UI toggle in TaskDetailPanel
- [ ] File attachments on tasks — upload images/docs/screenshots. Full slice: storage service abstraction (local + S3), Prisma model (Attachment), upload endpoint, TaskDetailPanel attachment section
- [ ] Task templates — reusable task structures for repeated workflows. Full slice: Prisma model (TaskTemplate), CRUD mutations, "Create from template" UI in project toolbar
- [ ] JSON string columns → centralized helpers — Sprint.columns, Task.suggestedTools (parseColumns/parseSuggestedTools helpers, not migration)
- [ ] Shared types between API and web — evaluate graphql-codegen or shared package for type safety
- [ ] Custom field DataLoader — customFieldValues field resolver currently uses direct query per task; add DataLoader for batch loading
- [ ] Custom field reordering UI — drag-to-reorder in ProjectSettingsModal (position field exists but no drag UI implemented)
- [ ] Custom field NUMBER/DATE filter controls — FilterBar only renders TEXT and DROPDOWN custom field filters, not number range or date picker

### W6: Advanced Views & AI Extras (remaining)
**Touches:** new `apps/web/src/components/` files, `resolvers/ai.ts`

- [ ] Public REST/GraphQL API docs — documented API for third-party use. Full slice: auto-generate from GraphQL schema using graphql-markdown or similar, serve at `/api/docs`, add auth token instructions

### D1: Deployment & Observability (Medium Priority)
**Why:** No metrics, no APM, no external monitoring. Railway basic healthcheck is the only signal.
**Touches:** `apps/api/src/app.ts`, `apps/api/src/index.ts`, Railway dashboard config

- [ ] Expose Prisma metrics at `/api/metrics` for Prometheus scraping
- [ ] Add structured request logging with latency, status code, and resolver name
- [ ] External uptime monitoring (Uptime Robot or similar)
- [ ] Railway alerting — configure alerts for restart loops, memory spikes, high CPU
- [ ] Staging environment — Railway preview deployments from PRs
- [ ] Database backup strategy — verify Railway PostgreSQL automated backups, document restore procedure

### I1: Integration Completeness (Medium Priority)
**Why:** Webhooks lack retry/delivery tracking, Slack only has one command, email has no HTML templates.
**Touches:** `apps/api/src/utils/webhookDispatcher.ts`, `apps/api/src/slack/`, `apps/api/src/utils/email.ts`, `apps/api/src/github/`

- [x] Webhook retry queue — exponential backoff with delivery log table showing status, attempts, next retry (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [x] Webhook delivery dashboard — UI in OrgSettings showing delivery history per endpoint with success/failure counts (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [x] Slack command expansion — added `/tasktoad list` and `/tasktoad status` with Block Kit formatting (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Slack user mapping — link Slack user ID to TaskToad user for auto-assignment on slash commands
- [x] Email HTML templates — branded templates for verification, password reset, invite (Wave 9, 2026-03-16)
- [ ] Wire HTML email templates into sendEmail callers — `buildVerifyEmailHtml`/`buildResetPasswordHtml`/`buildInviteHtml` exist but auth resolvers still only pass plain text
- [ ] Slack `/tasktoad list` assignee filtering — currently shows all tasks from first project, not user-specific (blocked on Slack user mapping)
- [ ] Email retry queue — retry failed SMTP sends with backoff instead of silent failure
- [ ] GitHub webhook retry — dead letter queue for failed webhook processing with manual replay

### F1: Frontend Performance (Low-Medium Priority)
**Why:** Missing virtualization on long lists, some unnecessary re-renders, JSON.parse in hot loops.
**Touches:** `apps/web/src/components/`, `apps/api/src/graphql/resolvers/project.ts`

- [ ] Virtualize long lists — use `react-window` or `@tanstack/virtual` for task lists (BacklogView, TableView) and activity feeds when > 100 items
- [ ] Memoize list item components — wrap ActivityFeed items and CommentItem in `React.memo`
- [ ] Cache parsed JSON at task level — `dependsOn` and `suggestedTools` are JSON.parse'd on every render in KanbanBoard; parse once and cache
- [ ] Lazy-load heavy view components — GanttChart, BatchCodeGenModal, DriftAnalysisModal with `React.lazy()`
- [ ] Portfolio query optimization — batch sprint queries instead of sequential per-project in `portfolioOverview` resolver

### S1: Styling & Branding (Low Priority — pending style guide)
**Why:** User is working on logos and a style guide. These items prep the codebase for a design system.
**Touches:** `apps/web/src/components/shared/`, `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`, `apps/web/index.html`, `apps/web/public/`

- [ ] PWA manifest + favicon + meta tags — `manifest.json`, `<meta>` description/theme-color/og:image, favicon.svg
- [ ] Design token system — extract hardcoded Tailwind colors into CSS custom properties or Tailwind theme tokens for easy rebrand when style guide is ready
- [ ] Button component library — standardize the 20+ ad-hoc button styles (`px-3 py-1.5 text-sm border rounded` repeated everywhere) into reusable `<Button variant="primary|secondary|ghost|danger">` component
- [ ] Consistent spacing/typography scale — audit and normalize padding, margin, font-size usage across components
- [ ] Dark mode prep — use Tailwind `dark:` variants on base components so dark mode can be toggled when ready
- [ ] Social preview image — og:image for link sharing (once logo is finalized)

## Parallelism Matrix

**Can run in parallel (no file overlap):**
- P1 (production) + A11 (accessibility) + I1 (integrations)
- P2 (security) + S1 (styling) + D1 (deployment)
- Q1 (code quality) + I1 (integrations) + F1 (performance)
- W2 (tasks/filters) + any non-W set

**Conflicts:**
- P1 + P2 (both touch `app.ts`)
- P1 + D1 (both touch `app.ts`, `index.ts`)
- A11 + Q1 (both touch components — but A11 is UI-level, Q1 is structural; could be split carefully)
- A11 + S1 (both touch component styling)

**Remaining legacy sets (W1, W2, W6):** All can run in parallel with each other — no file overlap.
