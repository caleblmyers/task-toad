### Swarm: Code generation pipeline + AI UX (Groups A, B)

Second swarm run — 3 workers, 5 tasks.

**Group A — AI Code Generation Pipeline:**
- Backend: `generateCode` in aiService + Zod schema + promptBuilder + aiConfig (8192 max tokens)
- GraphQL: `generateCodeFromTask` mutation with `GeneratedFile` and `CodeGeneration` types
- Frontend: `CodePreviewModal` with collapsible file previews, token cost display, "Create PR" button
- Full flow working: Task → Generate Instructions → Generate Code → Preview → Create PR on GitHub

**Group B — AI Generation UX:**
- Graceful rejection handling — after 3 rejections, shows context input for better results
- Iterative generation input — collapsible "Refine" section with refinement history

### GitHub integration fixes

- Fixed webhook signature verification: `express.json()` was parsing body before webhook route, breaking HMAC
- Fixed PKCS#1 → PKCS#8 key conversion for `jose` (GitHub generates PKCS#1 keys)
- Base64-encoded private key in `.env` (multi-line PEM not supported by Node env loading)
- GitHub App transferred to `tasktoad` org
- Popup-based GitHub App installation flow (replaces full-page navigation)

### Swarm improvements

- Added `task-update.sh` and `merge-worker.sh` helper scripts (reduces manual approvals)
- Workers now loop until all tasks merged, auto-rebase, self-fix on review feedback
- No remote pushes from workers/reviewer — only user pushes from main
- Added cross-group blocker isolation rules to planner

### Todos expansion

- Added 25 new feature items across PM parity gaps and AI pipeline enhancements
- New groups: M (User & Profile), N (Real-time), O (Data Portability)

### Swarm: Groups J, A, C (parallel development)

First swarm run — 3 workers + reviewer, 10 tasks across 3 groups.

**Group J — API Architecture (Tech Debt):**
- Split monolithic schema.ts (~2000 lines) into 10 domain resolver modules under `resolvers/`
- Added structured GraphQL error handling (7 error classes + requireAuth/requireAdmin guards)
- Added structured logging with pino (replaced all console.error/log calls)

**Group A — AI Reports:**
- Daily standup report — AI generates completed/inProgress/blockers from sprint data
- Sprint report — AI summary with completion rate, highlights, concerns, recommendations
- Project health analyzer — AI health score (0-100) with issues, strengths, action items
- Meeting notes → Tasks — AI extracts tasks from pasted meeting notes

**Group C — GitHub Integration:**
- GitHub issue sync — create GitHub issues from tasks, bidirectional status sync
- PR status on tasks — show linked PR status (open/merged/closed) on task cards
- Auto-link commits — parse branch names to associate commits with tasks

- Removed all completed items

### GitHub App Integration

Full GitHub App backend + frontend linking UI. 26 files changed, ~2,000 lines added.

**Backend (`apps/api/src/github/`):**
- `githubAppAuth.ts` — JWT generation (RS256), installation token caching with 1-min-before-expiry refresh
- `githubAppClient.ts` — GraphQL client for GitHub API
- `githubRepositoryService.ts` — connect/disconnect repos, create repos, list installation repos (REST)
- `githubCommitService.ts` — create branches, commit files via GitHub GraphQL
- `githubPullRequestService.ts` — create PRs
- `githubService.ts` — orchestration (create PR from task)
- `githubWebhookHandler.ts` — handles installation created/deleted events
- `githubTypes.ts` — shared interfaces
- `githubLogger.ts` — structured logging

**GraphQL:**
- Types: `GitHubInstallation`, `GitHubRepoLink`, `GitHubPullRequest`, `GitHubRepo`
- Queries: `githubInstallations`, `githubInstallationRepos`, `githubProjectRepo`
- Mutations: `linkGitHubInstallation`, `connectGitHubRepo`, `disconnectGitHubRepo`, `createGitHubRepo`, `createPullRequestFromTask`
- `githubRepositoryName`/`githubRepositoryOwner` fields on `Project` type

**Frontend:**
- `OrgSettings.tsx` — GitHub section showing installations with "Connected" badges, auto-links on callback redirect (`?installation_id=`), "Install GitHub App" button
- `GitHubRepoModal.tsx` — two-state modal (connected: show repo + disconnect; not connected: installation dropdown → repo list with filter → connect)
- `ProjectDetail.tsx` — GitHub icon button in toolbar showing `owner/repo` label, opens modal
- `IconGitHub` component added to shared Icons

**Prisma:**
- `GitHubInstallation` model + GitHub fields on `Project` (repositoryId, name, owner, installationId, defaultBranch)

### PM Platform Gap Analysis & Todo Overhaul

Compared TaskToad against 8 industry PM platforms (Asana, Jira, Linear, Monday, ClickUp, Notion, Wrike, Shortcut). Added 31 missing features across 9 categories to `todos.md`: collaboration (comments, activity feed, @mentions, file attachments), notifications (in-app, email, preferences), views (calendar, timeline/Gantt, table), task management (bulk actions, labels/tags, dependencies UI, rich text, archiving UI, recurring tasks), workflow (custom statuses, automation rules, task templates), reporting (burndown, velocity, dashboard), project management (edit details, portfolio), search (global search, saved filters), integrations (GitHub, Slack, webhooks, API docs), permissions (project-level roles). Added a prioritization section ranking all 58 uncompleted items across 7 tiers.

### Frontend Refactor — ProjectDetail Decomposition

Decomposed `ProjectDetail.tsx` from ~830 lines to ~357 lines (57% reduction). Extracted:
- `hooks/useProjectData.ts` (709 lines) — data fetching, mutations, sprint/task CRUD, AI ops
- `hooks/useTaskFiltering.ts` (63 lines) — search + status/priority/assignee filtering
- `hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` (100 lines) — j/k/Esc/n keyboard shortcuts
- `hooks/useToast.ts` (26 lines) — toast notification state
- `utils/taskHelpers.ts` (37 lines) — TASK_FIELDS, status↔column mapping
- `components/shared/` (5 files, 367 lines) — SearchInput, FilterBar, Icons, Toast, KeyboardShortcutHelp

Added semantic Tailwind colors (status/priority tokens) and animations (slide-in, fade-in). Removed 5 unused component files and 4 build artifacts.

### AI Subsystem Architecture Refactor

Decomposed monolithic `graphql/ai.ts` (367 lines) into dedicated `src/ai/` subsystem (10 files, 811 lines):

```
src/ai/
  index.ts          — barrel (public API)
  aiTypes.ts        — Zod schemas + inferred types
  aiConfig.ts       — model, per-feature max tokens, cost constants, system prompts
  aiClient.ts       — Anthropic wrapper (client reuse, error mapping, cache, size check)
  aiService.ts      — 6 feature functions with retry-on-validation-failure
  promptBuilder.ts  — per-feature prompt templates with context compression
  responseParser.ts — stripFences + Zod-validated JSON parsing
  tokenEstimator.ts — prompt size estimation + context window guard
  aiLogger.ts       — structured usage logging (feature, tokens, cost, latency, cache)
  aiCache.ts        — in-memory LRU cache (50 entries, TTL-based)
```

New capabilities: client reuse (cached per API key), auto-retry on Zod validation failure, LRU response caching (enabled for summarizeProject, 5min TTL), pre-flight prompt size estimation, structured JSON logging with cost estimates, centralized per-feature config, context compression (truncate descriptions to 200 chars, project text to 400 chars, cap sibling lists at 15), deterministic preprocessing (tasks pre-grouped by status for summaries).

Estimated token savings: summarizeProject ~60-80% reduction, generateTaskInstructions ~20-40% on large projects.

### Documentation

Updated: `todos.md`, `app-overview.md`, `decisions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
